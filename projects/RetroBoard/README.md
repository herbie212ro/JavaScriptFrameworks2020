# Project 1: Retro Board

4/20/2020

The Retro Board project uses Javascript React to display three Retro-Board columns.  You may add items to the three retro-boards, and move items between the retro-boards. You may also select likes or dislikes for each of the retro-board items.

Getting Started

yarn start
```
