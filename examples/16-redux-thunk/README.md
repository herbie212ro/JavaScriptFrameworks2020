## Getting Started

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

Using your command line, you will need to navigate to the this folder, install all dependencies, and start the app.

```bash
cd examples/16-redux-thunk/
code . # if you would like to open this in a separate VSCode window
yarn install
```

You will need to have two terminal windows open and running at once. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can click on the split-screen or plus icon in your terminal panel:

![Split screen icon in Visual Studio code](../../resources/authentication-server/two-terminals.png)

In one terminal window, you will need to run the the back-end server for this example. To start the server run `yarn server`.

In the other terminal window, start the front-end server with `yarn start`.

```bash
cd examples/11c-authentication-routing/ # If you are not in the 11c-authentication-routing folder
yarn start
```
